    "##### A **compound assignment operator** combines an arithmetic (or other) operation with an assignment in one statement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**For example, instead of writing:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "score = score + 10;\n",
    "```\n",
    "**You can write:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "score += 10;\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Learning Goals For End of Lesson\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:\n",
    "- Transform clunky `x = x + y` statements into sleek compound assignments\n",
    "- Master all the essential operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `++`, `--`)\n",
