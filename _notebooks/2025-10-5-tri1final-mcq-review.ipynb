    "\n",
    "Overall, my performance showed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strong accuracy on **Units 1–3** (variables, conditionals, loops, objects).\n",
    "- Concentrated mistakes in **Unit 4** (2D array traversal, recursion, file input).\n",
    "- One logic/loop translation slip in a Unit 2 question.\n",
    "\n",
    "I missed **6 questions out of 42** (Questions **14, 29, 32, 36, 38, 42**). These errors are actually very informative—they all point to a few specific conceptual blind spots rather than random guessing.\n",

    "### Q14 – Equivalent Boolean Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topic:** Compound Boolean logic and De Morgan’s Law\n",
    "\n",
    "**What I did wrong (honestly):**\n",
    "I basically tried to “invert everything” in my head and ended up treating:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "!(A && B)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "as if it were:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "!A && !B   // ❌ not equivalent\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I remembered that the `!` distributes, but I forgot that the **operator has to flip** as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct reasoning:**\n",
    "De Morgan’s Law says:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `!(A && B)` is equivalent to `!A || !B`\n",
    "* `!(A || B)` is equivalent to `!A && !B`\n",
    "\n",
    "So an example like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Original condition\n",
    "!(isEven && isPositive) && isPrime\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Correctly simplified\n",
    "(!isEven || !isPositive) && isPrime\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mini truth-table check (for A && B):**\n",
    "\n",
    "| A     | B     | A && B | !(A && B) | !A || !B |\n",
    "|-------|-------|--------|-----------|----------|\n",
    "| true  | true  | true   | false     | false    |\n",
    "| true  | false | false  | true      | true     |\n",
    "| false | true  | false  | true      | true     |\n",
    "| false | false | false  | true      | true     |\n",
    "\n",
    "The last two columns always match, so the expressions are equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**New rule for myself:**\n",
    "Whenever I see a `!(` around a whole condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Distribute** the `!` to each part.\n",
    "2. **Flip** `&&` ↔ `||`.\n",
    "3. If I’m unsure, I quickly check one or two rows with a tiny truth table, instead of guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q29 – Recursive `printNums` Method\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topic:** Recursion and order of output\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public static void printNums(int n) {\n",
    "    if (n < 50) {\n",
    "        printNums(n * -2);\n",
    "        System.out.print(n + \" \");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where I went wrong:**\n",
    "I paid too much attention to how `n` changes (`n * -2`) and basically ignored **when** the `print` happens. I imagined the values printing in the same order as the calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, the print statement is **after** the recursive call, so values print as the recursion *unwinds*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trace example:** `printNums(10)`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `n = 10` → `10 < 50` → call `printNums(-20)`\n",
    "2. `n = -20` → `-20 < 50` → call `printNums(40)`\n",
    "3. `n = 40` → `40 < 50` → call `printNums(-80)`\n",
    "4. Depending on the exact base-case condition used in the original question, eventually the recursion stops, and then prints happen **in reverse call order**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Call order:** `10 → -20 → 40 → ...`\n",
    "* **Print order:** `... → 40 → -20 → 10`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight:**\n",
    "For recursion, there are two classic patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Print before recursive call** → prints in “forward” order.\n",
    "* **Print after recursive call** → prints in “reverse/unwind” order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**New habit:**\n",
    "When I see a recursive method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mark where the **print/return** happens (before or after recursive call).\n",
    "2. Do a quick 3–4 step trace on scratch paper to see the actual order instead of guessing.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q32 – 2D Array Data into an `ArrayList`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topic:** 2D array traversal with a specific pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The question gave a 2D array (for example):\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int[][] mat = {\n",
    "    {10, 20, 30},\n",
    "    {40, 50, 60}\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And wanted output like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "[30, 20, 10, 60, 50, 40]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**My incorrect assumption:**\n",
    "I thought the code needed to reverse **both** the row order *and* the column order, so I was looking for something that went from **bottom-right upward** (bottom row first, then top row).\n",
    "\n",
    "But the requested output actually does this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Goes **row by row, top to bottom**,\n",
    "* Within each row, goes **right to left**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the correct traversal pattern is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();\n",
    "\n",
    "for (int row = 0; row < mat.length; row++) {                 // normal row order\n",
    "    for (int col = mat[0].length - 1; col >= 0; col--) {     // reverse column order\n",
    "        list.add(mat[row][col]);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mental model that helps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Split the pattern into **two separate questions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Row direction:** top→bottom or bottom→top?\n",
    "2. **Column direction:** left→right or right→left?\n",
    "\n",
    "Then make the loops match exactly:\n",
    "\n",
    "* top→bottom ⇒ `row = 0; row < rows; row++`\n",
    "* bottom→top ⇒ `row = rows - 1; row >= 0; row--`\n",
    "* left→right ⇒ `col = 0; col < cols; col++`\n",
    "* right→left ⇒ `col = cols - 1; col >= 0; col--`\n",

    "### Q36 – `my2Darr` After Nested Traversal\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topic:** Nested loops and index conditions like `r == c`\n",
    "\n",
    "The array was a **4×3** matrix. That means:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Valid rows: `0, 1, 2, 3`\n",
    "* Valid columns: `0, 1, 2`\n",
    "\n",
    "The code only changed elements where `row == col`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where I slipped up:**\n",
    "I treated the `row == col` condition like it was filling a “diagonal” that extended further than the actual number of columns. I forgot that the array only has 3 columns, so `(3,3)` **does not exist**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only valid `(row, col)` where `row == col` in a 4×3 array are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `(0, 0)`\n",
    "* `(1, 1)`\n",
    "* `(2, 2)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Those are the only cells that get updated. Everything else stays whatever it was initially.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, the resulting array looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int[][] my2Darr = {\n",

    "    {0, 1, 0},\n",
    "    {0, 0, 2},\n",
    "    {0, 0, 0}\n",
    "};\n",

    "* `r == c`\n",
    "* `r + c == constant`\n",
    "* `r < c`, `r > c`\n",
    "\n",
    "I will **always**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write down how many rows and columns there are.\n",
    "2. List out which `(r, c)` pairs are even possible.\n",
    "3. Only apply the condition inside that valid range.\n",

    "### Q38 – Building Two `ArrayList`s Using a `Scanner`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topic:** File/text input and splitting tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea was: given some input (for example, tokens like `\"first_second\"`), create two `ArrayList<String>` objects that each store one part of the split.\n",
    "\n",
    "**My mistake:**\n",
    "I tried to use **two separate loops** over the same `Scanner`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* First loop: fill `list1`\n",
    "* Second loop: fill `list2`\n",
    "\n",
    "But after the first loop finishes, the `Scanner` has already consumed the entire file/stream. The second loop finds *no* remaining input.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct strategy:**\n",
    "Read each token **once**, split it, and put each part into the appropriate list **inside the same loop**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "ArrayList<String> firstList  = new ArrayList<>();\n",
    "ArrayList<String> secondList = new ArrayList<>();\n",
    "\n",

    "    String token = sc.next();          // e.g. \"alpha_beta\"\n",

    "    firstList.add(parts[0]);\n",
    "    secondList.add(parts[1]);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core principle:**\n",
    "A `Scanner` moves **forward only**. There’s no built-in rewind. If each line/token carries data for multiple structures, process it in *one pass* rather than trying to loop again later.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Topic:** Translating a `while` loop into a `for` loop correctly\n",

    "    j++;\n",
    "    sum += j;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What actually happens here:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Before the first iteration: `j = 0`, `sum = 0`\n",
    "* Loop condition: `j <= 5`\n",
    "* Inside the loop: increment `j` **first**, then add the new `j` to `sum`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Values of `j` that get added to `sum` are: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6`.\n",

    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "for (int j = 0; j <= 5; j++) {\n",
    "    sum += j;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the values added are `0,1,2,3,4,5`, which is a different sequence. I ignored the fact that the original loop had both the **explicit increment inside the body** and the **condition that allows j to reach 6**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct equivalent `for` loop:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",

    "    sum += j;\n",

    "2. Track precisely **when and how often** it changes (inside body vs. loop header).\n",

    "  * 2D array traversal (rows vs. columns, order).\n",
    "* **Thinking in terms of data flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Scanner consuming input only once.\n",
    "  * How data is split and stored in collections.\n",
